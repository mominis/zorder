This project contains a reference implementation of the Z-sorted collection
described in the article under docs/

The article details an always-sorted collection providing O(1):
* Addition of new elements
* Removal of existing elements; and
* Change of Z-order

In addition, the collection gives O(n) traversal in-order of the collection.    

The main classes are: SimpleZCollection and FixedPointZCollection under the
com.mominis.zorder package.
